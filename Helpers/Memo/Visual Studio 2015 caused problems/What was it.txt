After installing Visual Studio 2015 Preview, a lot of things got ruined:
* The app won't build. There are problems around
** WinStore projects
** Portable projects (fixed)
** MS SQL Server instance (fixed)
*** This one I manually reinstalled, that seemed to solve the problem

Solution for the Portable projects I found here:
"Visual Studio 2013 error  ‘Windows.props’ not found. - Joydeep Ghosh.mht"
* Reinstall Windows Phone 8.1 SDK
** The 8.1 version is needed, the 8.0 is not enough; even if there wasn't 8.1 on the machine before
* Repair Visual Studio 2013 in Control Panel/Programs and ...
* Clean the Solution, also manually delete the bin and obj folders. If there are still problems, try to checkout/clone the repository into a new, virgin folder
