The .pfx is used at the temporary code certificate to sign your app for deployment to your machine so you can debug. You can remove it, but a new temporary key will need to be generated (via the Packaging tab in the package.appxmanifest dialog). I always leave it in the code I post since it is easier on the person using the code (i.e., no error messages). If you look at some other WinRT source projects (MVVMLight, for example) they also include the .pfx for convenience.
